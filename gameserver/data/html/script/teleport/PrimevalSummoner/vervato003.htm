<html><body>Vervato:<br>
Hey, do you have money or not? Did you expect me to resurrect you without paying? Keep bothering me like this and you'll have more trouble than you know what to do with! I have magic that can send this corpse so far from the chasm of death that it will never be revived!<br>
<a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Quest PrimevalSummoner">Pay the fee and revive the corpse (200,000 Adena).</a>

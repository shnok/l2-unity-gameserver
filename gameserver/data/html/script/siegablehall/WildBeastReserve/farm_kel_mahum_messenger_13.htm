They don't respond well to beatings. The only reason I was able to capture them is their susceptibility to magic.<br> <a action="bypass -h Quest WildBeastReserve reselect_npc">"I want to choose another NPC."</a><br> <a action="bypass -h Quest WildBeastReserve select_npc_3"> "I want to form an alliance."</a>

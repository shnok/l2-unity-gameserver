Grarr! The building behind me that emanates such a clear and refreshing energy is the <font color="LEVEL">Rainbow Spring. </font> It is very different from other clan halls, which are often the object of conquest. Here you may enjoy a game in a friendly, relaxed atmosphere. Once the game ends, the victor will claim a reward.<br>
If you believe that you can defeat the <font color="LEVEL">%owner%</font> clan that won the previous game, make your challenge! <br><br>
Deadline to register for participation:  <font color="LEVEL">%time% </font><br><br>

This function opens and closes the clan hall door.<br> 
When the door open, anyone can enter -- even those who are not members of the clan. For security purposes, you should keep the door closed as much as possible.<br>
If you wish to expel non-clan members, use the <a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_banish_foreigner list">Expel Outsider</a> menu.<br>
